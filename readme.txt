Preprocess the data:

Step 1 : Parse the device_local_date column as datetime objects.
Extract the day of the week from the datetime objects.
Sort the data by shopping_center_id and day_of_week.

Step 2 : Identify the opening hours for each center:
Iterate over each unique shopping center in the dataset.
Filter the data for the current center.
Calculate the time difference between consecutive device_local_date entries for each day of the week.
Identify the longest time interval for each day of the week, which represents the opening hours.

Step 3 : Calculate the average opening hours for each day of the week:

Iterate over each day of the week (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday, and so on).
Collect the opening hours for that day from each center.
Calculate the average opening hours for that day by taking the mean of the opening hours across all centers.

Step 4 : Use the average opening hours as a reference for the new center:
Retrieve the attendance data for the new center.
Calculate the time difference between  visits for each day of the week.
Compare the time differences with the average opening hours for each respective day.
Determine the opening hours for the new center based on how closely the time differences match the average opening hours.

To handle errors, we can modify the code to exclude the "NaT" values from the calculations.
